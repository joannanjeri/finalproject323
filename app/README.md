# Final Project

This project is a food delivery application designed for mobile devices. The app allows users to 
browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders for delivery. It features user authentication, 
a gallery of restaurant images, and a detailed ordering process.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can sign up, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication
* [ ] User can view a list of restaurants, including images, names, and locations
* [ ] User can select a restaurant to view its menu and place orders
* [ ] Each restaurant displays a gallery of images that users can swipe through
* [ ] Menu items for each restaurant include an add-to-order functionality
* [ ] Users can view recent orders and restaurant selections

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* Integration with maps for restaurant locations and delivery tracking
* User profile customization with image uploads

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered while building the app included managing user authentication states, 
integrating Firebase Firestore for real-time data updates, and handling image uploads and retrieval. 
I also struggled with the swipeable image gallery and ensuring a responsive and user-friendly UI
